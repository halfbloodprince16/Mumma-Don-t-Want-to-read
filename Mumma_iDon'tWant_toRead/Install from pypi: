Install from pypi:
	pip install talkey

If you get a talkey.base.TTSError: No supported languages error, it means that you donâ€™t have a supported TTS engine installed. Please see below.

By default it will try to locate and use the local instances of the following TTS engines:

Flite
SVOX Pico
Festival
eSpeak
mbrola via eSpeak
Installing one or more of those engines should allow the libary to function and generate speech.

It also supports the following networked TTS Engines:

MaryTTS (needs hosting)
Google TTS (cloud hosted)
